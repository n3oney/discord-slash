# discord-slash

A PoC Deno Discord Bot library made for the sole purpose of using Slash Commands.

Made in a few hours. The code is probably a bit messy as I didn't spend a lot of time thinking about the structure, etc.

###### Notice: This was made just to have fun with the _new_ slash commands. I wanted to check how they worked in practice (even found a bug in the iOS Discord app). This was never meant to be production-ready.
